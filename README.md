# Covered California Public Health Analysis

This repository explores public health enrollment patterns in California using datasets on language and race from the California Health and Human Services Open Data Portal. The goal is to identify disparities in insurance access and support policy recommendations that improve multilingual and multicultural outreach.

## ðŸ“‚ Datasets Used

- [Primary Spoken Language Dataset (2016â€“2024)](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/fd8ee614-b247-4742-a729-f30f47c5beaa)
- [Race of Individuals Selecting QHP Dataset (2016â€“2024)](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/255ac729-b152-49f4-9852-d7b747503f0c)

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations

- Total enrollment by language (excluding English)
- Language trends over time (quarterly)
- Quarterly stacked enrollment share
- Enrollment by race

## ðŸ§ª Tools

- R (tidyverse, janitor, ggplot2, forcats, scales)
- CSV data manipulation and plotting

## ðŸ’¡ Key Findings

- Spanish and Mandarin dominate non-English enrollment, but smaller groups like Farsi, Tagalog, and Hmong remain underrepresented.
- Racial disparities mirror language access gaps, particularly among Pacific Islander, Indigenous, and Southeast Asian communities.
- Seasonal spikes (Q4â€“Q1) suggest reliance on short-term campaigns.

## âœ… Policy Recommendation

Increase culturally and linguistically inclusive outreach within Covered California by:
- Funding multilingual navigators
- Translating all core materials into top spoken languages
- Partnering with community orgs for culturally relevant enrollment support
